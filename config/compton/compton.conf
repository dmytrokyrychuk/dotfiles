# --- Shadows (Disable with shadow = false;)
# The shadow exclude options are helpful if you have shadows enabled.
# Due to the way compton draws its shadows, certain applications (Such as
# shaped windows, custom popups, non-standard toolkits) will have visual glitches.

shadow = false;				# Enabled client-side shadows on windows.

# --- Fading (Disable with fading = false;)

fading = true;				# Fade windows during opacity changes.
fade-delta = 5;				# The time between steps in a fade in milliseconds. (default 5).
fade-in-step = 0.03;		# Opacity change between steps while fading in. (default 0.03).
fade-out-step = 0.03;		# Opacity change between steps while fading out. (default 0.03).
